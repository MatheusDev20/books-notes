# Dynamic dispatch.

Key concept of OO Programing languages, it allow Subclass methods to override a superclass when called in a instance object.
Because its change the lookup rules, by how this method look the "self" value the current object value.


# Key difference with closures.

This is the key diference between closures and objects, when i create a function in a language that implements closure, that lexical scope is "closured"
By that, i mean that there is no way to override the functions defined in that enviroment, its already closured by the lexical scope.

So, to sum up dyamic dispatch give O.O Languages objects, with method call.
